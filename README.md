mi_Python_Modules
=================

You need these modules to run any of the mi_ Python code.

They provide general purpose features such as error handling
and file processing used in most mi_ python code.

These files should be in a single directory at the same level as
the directory containing your mi_ code.

For example:  

Project directory/
    Modules/
    MI Python Code/
        <file_that_needs_module>.py
        <file_that_needs_module>.py
        ...

If you look at some of the headers in the .py files of code that uses
these modules, you will see that they refer to ../Modules
